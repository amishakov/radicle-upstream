# ⚠️ Upstream has been sunsetted ⚠️

Read more about it [here](https://radicle.community/t/upstream-july-2022-community-update).
To discover and interact with projects on the Radicle protocol, please use the
[web app](https://app.radicle.network) and [Radicle CLI](https://radicle.network)
tooling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upstream is a cross-platform desktop client for the Radicle code collaboration
protocol.

At the moment we support Linux and macOS. Latest packages for these platforms
are available on the [Radicle website][rw].

Windows support is considered experimental at this stage -- we don't provide
packages for this platform, so you'll have to build it from source.

The [UI][ui] is written in JavaScript using [Svelte][sv] and Electron and the
node [proxy][pr] logic is implemented in [Rust][ru].

A good entry point for exploration is [`development.md`][de], where you'll find
information on how to build Upstream from source.

If you're looking to contribute, take a look at [`contributing.md`][co] to
learn about the different ways that we accept contributions.

If you have questions or would like to get in touch, check out
[radicle.community][rc].

## Building and running Upstream

Prerequisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup)

To build Upstream, run

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dist
```

This command will create an application package in the `./dist` folder which
you can then run.

## Development Builds

You can download the latest development build here

* <https://storage.googleapis.com/radicle-upstream-build-artifacts/v1/main/radicle-upstream.AppImage>
* <https://storage.googleapis.com/radicle-upstream-build-artifacts/v1/main/radicle-upstream.dmg>

The development builds for macOS are unsigned. See [this
article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) on how to
run unsigned apps on macOS.
