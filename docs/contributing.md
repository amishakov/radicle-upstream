# Contributing to Radicle Upstream

## Learn more about Upstream

To familiarise yourself with Upstream and the Radicle ecosystem, have a look at
the following resources:

- [development.md][dm] for more information on building Upstream locally
- [Discord][dc]
- [radicle.xyz][ra]
- [Radicle documentation][rd]

## Your first contribution to Upstream

If you find a bug or see an [issue][oi] you'd like to fix, we are keen on
receiving a contribution from you.

We accept contributions through Upstream Patches -- our first version
of Pull Requests in Upstream. Follow [this guide][tg] to create your first
patch.

In case there's an issue with Upstream Patches, we are also accepting
[Pull Requests through GitHub][pr] as a fallback option.

### Certificate of Origin

We require commits to be signed off to show your agreement to the
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)][do]. This means that the messages of
all your commits must include the following line at the end.

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

You can create commits with this line by running `git commit -s`.

The DCO was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a simple statement
that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.
